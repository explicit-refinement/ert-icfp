- Make Agda ∀ like, not
- Grey out ghosts, ∀ dot

Refinement logic contains full FOL {(we don't allow quantifying over props)} with inductions
^ but the language itself is HO!!!
^ flash types: including FOL (∀, ∃, =)

Erasure: grey stuff go awey
^ ok actually not quite

Move assumption type to the end

renotational pedantics

error stop not exceptions

do what mevin said about subsets

TRADE OFFER: you give me a γ, I give you a ⊆

Want an example w.r.t erasure: see PDF

Semantics must depend on input of context

Show functions (many people will have seen logical relations!)

"fancy types are interpreted w/ a logical predicate"

No subsets for props; function into prop

Future work is a meme... put your contact on the recap
